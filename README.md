# Yang Personal Development Webpage
**Personal webpage started in the summer of 2018 and continued onwards.**

The actual hosted domain can be found [here](http://richard-yang-chen.com).

## Updates (as of 05/14/19)
* Updated [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and other dependencies
* Finalized new front page title layout 
* Fixed navbar mobile-view

## Current Features
* Parallax portraits that navigate to the individual peer stories
* About page detailing the motivation of the project
* Influences gallery where all the peer stories can be accessed

## Motivation
I originally started this webpage with the idea that I would just be messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn some basic front end developmentâ€”and mess around I did. However, I eventually came to a more concrete idea that I could use the domain to host a collection of writing projects and eventually a personal portfolio. I enjoy sharing my writing with others and being able to explore both ends of my interests in web development and writing through this project is an opportunity I value deeply in my personal learning.

## Upcoming Changes
* Rewrite the project in Python Flask to implement a comments system and refactor the overall project
* Add a new page to hold the upcoming "Thanks Me" writing project
* Revised home page to be more user-friendly on mobile and desktop screens
