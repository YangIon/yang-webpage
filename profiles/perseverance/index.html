                    ell I googled perseverance because it was the first word that came to mind when I thought of her. So let's talk about perseverance for a bit.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Google defines it as “steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.” At times, it’s just a remarkably nice-sounding buzzword that others like to use to convince you to do something you may not realistically be able to do. Sometimes, that mentioning of perseverance is a point of weakness—my point of weakness—because it often implies that there <i>will</i> be major difficulty rather than can be major difficulty along the undefined amount of time it takes to achieve whatever made such a troublesome perseverance worth it in the first place. And in some guise of being technical about it, how are you to know if the benefits outweigh the costs?
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    So perseverance can be something to be feared or something to be loved; the effort and the passion directed towards a meaningful goal are the admirable parts—otherwise it would be insanity.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    For her, perseverance might mean pulling several all-nighters to paint the <b>most insightful portrait</b> of every topic she covers as a journalist, editing several underclassmen college essays—and a friend's PhD application essay—at last minute requests, or being a constant presence for when a random, troubled writer came knocking on her door for late night advice, coffee excluded. Quaint.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    She is her <b>own art</b>. The graceful dancer powering through weekly several-hour dance performances on a <b>"more than sore" ankle</b>, the empowering activist organizing one of the largest marches the city of Greensboro (otherwise "Greensboring") has ever witnessed, the humble soul whose actions are all done with an <b>absurdly consistent modesty</b> that everyone else around her comes first in spite of the responsibilities she assumes.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    And it's fascinating to me, knowing that each person experiences some form of adversity within themselves, that she does all this <b>with the easiest smile</b> to her face, straight whites invisibly laced with straight confidence.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Often when I meet her, I get a little-maybe-more-than-a-little concerned for her. Knowing only a fraction of the whole works she puts herself through, I don't imagine I could pull it off. Sometimes life throws a storm at her and she's at the helm of a ship that has to break through the waves. A person like that can only be described as strong and inspiring, but it can be a little... taxing.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Because in those moments when we want to be our picture-best, we might find it easy to <b>abstract our problems under a happy face or an off-handed remark</b> rather than confront them right then and there. So how she embraces perseverance within multiple ends of her life: externally, internally, perhaps something in between those two(?) is something of a great lesson I've learned from her. That's the way I see it as her friend.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Full of calm smiles, excited faces, and mocking expressions at her own doubts, she's a really consoling sort of character. A calming presence who <b>wears her strength casually</b>, holding to bubbly, effervescent conversations which lend people a lot more assurance in whatever they do, eliciting a perseverance beyond herself. I'm reminded of the small things, the minute details she puts care into: the coffee past hours at 2 a.m., <b>abridged recitations of her favorite Hindu fables</b>, artsy handwritten letters to teachers, friends, and family.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Personally, I appreciate her for all the talks we've had in the couple years we've known each other. Each one has built <b>my personal connection</b> towards reflecting on meaningful relationships, emotional insecurity, self-love—just a few items that I find it incredibly simple to talk to her about because she is just <i>there</i> in the moment, sharing out of a mode for compassionate feelings over convenience. Knowing that she has instilled in my life <b>a library</b> of lessons that comfort me to fully live, laugh, and love, I find it difficult to ever write about a friendship that has meant <b>a little more than the world</b> to me.
