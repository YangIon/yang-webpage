                    or everything I will say about Praveena from this point on, the nickname might not strike you as being particularly appropriate. From a very individual perspective (me, myself, and I), it is exactly the name she deserves! My poor explanation of the semantics aside, Praveena is first and foremost a very remarkable figure in my life.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Throughout our time as friends, she's taken up a variety of roles as an emotional confidant, book consultant, and someone who invariably has a thoughtful experience or perspective on hand. Her forthright demeanour and uncanny ability to inspire plenty of confidence in others runs parallel with her position as a wonderful journalist—to some degree, writing her story into others' lives with beautiful lines all the way through.

                    Although my writing will never fully commit to this page exactly how valuable a presence my peers provide in my life, I would like to devote a few paragraphs to exploring what I experienced with each individual and what I learned—and continue to learn—from them.

                <h2 class = "b">A New Face</h2>

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I first came to know about Praveena through a mutual friend of ours in June, 2016.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    At the time, she was simply the girl who had transferred herself into my junior year class at the Early College at Guilford. However, it was rare for any new students to come in due to the small class size—a splendid motley of fifty some kids who liked to stress about their schoolwork and futures more than they slept. Even if everybody was not necessarily close to one another, names were easy to tack down into memory.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    So when I first heard about Praveena, curiosity did pull at my thoughts a little more than I expected. I was certainly presumptuous, but I wanted to find out what type of a perspective she might bring for someone entering the school halfway through their high school career. How did she view adjusting to a smaller class? What brought her to come here? Cats or dogs? The last one wasn't so irrelevant; I realized they were all typical, tedious, trite questions.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Going into my third year at this school, I felt oddly caught between what I might consider a slightly atypical high school experience and a stress culture. It was never any workload or setting that impressed on me that I might reject my school, but the attitudes some of us took up, me included, that catered more and more towards achieving even the most trivial accomplishments to, well, make us feel even a little more accomplished. Why? Because maybe we couldn't see ourselves nearing—mostly—happiness with ourselves and our efforts without satisfying all these random goals that we might not even need in our lives anyhow. In a way, sometimes we would ward off meaningful people from our lives without intending to only to feel a little bit more isolated than before.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    On the other hand, I thought it could just be me. And as it would turn out, I ended up not speaking to her once for a good part of two semesters.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Moments in which I was going to speak with her concurred with moments that I realized I was
                    <i>probably</i> getting ahead of myself by preparing to bombard a stranger with hundreds of questions all at once. Stupid thoughts: all or nothing, right? I chose the latter.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Overall, that was likely the natural thing to do—let bygones be bygones—and dare I say it (<i>dramatic pause</i>) a little bit more normal. Not for me. Not for Yang. Not for this random midget fretting over the minute details at every point in time of his life.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Flash forward a few months after the school year begins and I find myself face-to-face with a random bout of unforgiveness towards the only person I could ever feel it for: myself. A few months down the line, I would learn to call my misgivings "impostor syndrome."
                    As much as the psychological phenomenon manifests its ugly head for a lot of people, I painted in my
                    mind that I felt like a fraud alone, selfish because I knew I wasn't alone yet privileged enough to do
                    so, and tapered down by a whole slew of similar contradictions that I couldn't resolve in my head. Some days I would sleep it off, others I would find myself walking down empty halls of my school's science wing past hours. There I wondered aloud often about what I could do next to feel—albeit artificially—fulfilled in some manner.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Later, the romanticizing side of me saw it as somewhat fate then (that's adorable, me!) that I found Praveena residing in
                    the same hall that I happened to oh-so coincidentally be eviscerating my mood in. In reality, it was
                    more logistical convenience that she happened to be in the building at the exact moment. But as soon
                    as she came into view, I immediately resolved to make a
                    <i>sharp</i> one hundred and eighty degree turn to not embarrass myself anymore than I might have. But you know what? She probably heard every single word anyways. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I found myself facing her eye-to-eye with a good five feet in between us anyways.
                </p>

                <h2 class="b">Familiar Stranger</h2>

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Two people with nothing in common initially except a pair of quizzical eyes. Meek small talk. You might know it from a bad '90s sitcom. An awkward question about classes here, a half-hearted comment
                    about how daily life is running smoothly there. Hell, I wouldn't be too surprised if I unconsciously
                    threw in a cheesy remark about the weather at some point. You would think I was a shy boy confessing
                    to her, but really I was just a nervous wreck around everyone, including some of my own friends. Relatable? I hope so. Yet throughout
                    my dribbling mess of conversation, Praveena lended me her undivided attention and responded
                    well in tandem. My nerves gradually began screaming less at me to silence my guttural nonsense than they were encouraging me to relax and open up to someone who genuinely wanted to listen.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Even with the feelings of lost confidence that typified my angsty teenage life, I found an endless string of words tumbling out of my mouth, the coat of insecurity that I kept up around many of my peers gradually shedding away. One way or another, she actually ended up answering the questions that I had for her previously; however, this time they weren't marked with shades of artificiality as when I felt I had to explicitly ask them. Instead, our conversation became a mutual exchange for two strangers to be a little more open than they normally were.
                </p>

                    I tended to subconsciously ascribe too many of my negative feelings to other people. Now there was someone else who shared the same action. What Praveena and I felt was that the relationships we established with others 


                    If anything, I became drawn in by how she spoke with humble ambition. Praveena described her life in terms of how she felt she could and had made an impact on the communities she was in. However, this idea wasn't based on what she thought she could achieve towards her success, but rather a number of passions that drove success to follow her instead. By then, she was already developing a pension for questioning her relationship to society, how we approach global issues, and I suppose—if you'll forgive my writing—how our world can be a better place to live in through even a single individual's effort.
                    
                    The relationships we established with others and the impact of our actions within them became a prime topic. What we both felt we lacked was personal connection to a community. Yet our notions of "community" could be difficult in school due, in large part, to the nontransparent nature of  interactions between the student body and the consequent shortfall of intimacy(?), trust(?), some unknown factor that always instigates a slight pause in my train of thought(?).

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    If you haven't figured it out already, I overthink. A lot. At every decision I make is an implicit question of how much I should just experience vs. how much I should analyze. The former is derived from how often I reprimand myself for standing on the brink of paranoia while the latter is borne by this itching feeling that I can't trust myself to be naturally considerate or aware of others if it becomes necessary.

                    A poorly designed conflict with Praveena summarized (and it really was childish thinking on my part):

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Just a random bit of notation for frustration :). I'd like to first point out that in no way do I mean to construct labels onto Praveena as a person. There really is no exception to a statement like, "People are dynamic." Friends, family, strangers, oddballs, funballs... they're never one hundred percent constant in their personality (which is obvious, but I like to reiterate) and no one should expect them to be. So forgive me for seeming incredibly absolute in the next following paragraphs, but they do represent a great deal of how I view Praveena.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    At eighteen, I'm a freshman at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and incredibly excited to be attending with someone who you may or may not have just read about in the last few minutes. Despite our differing interests and schedules, Praveena and I find time to share the dumbest, happiest, most stressful, and most inspiring events developing around us. These conversations are small pieces of what made the last year and a half of high school an overall happy time for me; a time in which I gained a considerable amount of perspective and contentment. Yet the transition to college showed me that I have an overwhelming amount to learn about taking care of myself and figuring out who I am, where my relationships lie, or  
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Grit. A subtle determination that embeds itself into my mentality, but not nearly as deeply as it does hers. One quote out of many that I've recorded from our talks captures this well:
                </p>
            
            <blockquote class="mt0 ml5-ns ml0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2 b--gold">
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure i">
                    That possibility [of giving up completely] is always in the periphery, but many people don't give up, that's the thing. Some people go through really terrible circumstances only to persevere to see what they can create in the future. I think that's a beautiful thing. There's so much in store, whether people realize it or not.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I suppose that's the crux of the matter here. Since the time I have met her, Praveena has continually pushed herself beyond the stuggles she does encounter in her life to genuinely make the best of things. We're often told to do this when we're infants, as teenagers, as adults, maybe even by the time we're old and stooped over ourselves; sometimes the act after the words doesn't take place. Yet for Praveena, there's that perseverance in how she acts every day. She juggles a variety of responsibilities from dance and journalism 
                </p>
                <!-- Maybe reorganize into ending first and then branch out to talk about why that conclusion about that person exists? -->
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Deliberateness. Praveena has a fascinating propensity to discern her identity even with a multitude of competing influences around her. For one, it's found in how she is able to distinguish her ambitions and passions from what other people may try to lead (or pressure) her towards without tending towards excessive stubbornness. And then there is how she articulates her beliefs. I don't particularly understand how I can express this in words, but when she speaks there's something in my brain that's exclaiming to me, <i>THIS is Praveena.</i> The thoughts and concerns she reveals may be similar in nature to what I hear from many of my peers, yet I see them as being contained in a well-familiar book. The one that you eagerly reminisce about when you look at the spine, head cocked at a forty-five degree angle to see the author's name emblazoned onto it. When I see that name, I remember the structure and style of the words—how idiosyncratically related they were to the author and how they resonated in me. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I think a lot of people can relate to this. They might recall how close and comforting an author's story was to them purely due to the way they were presented, showing evidence that each word was carefully thought upon. And if one can imagine this, then they have a fairly good understanding of how it feels to view this side of Praveena as a friend of hers.
