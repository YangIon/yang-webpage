                    t some point in the autumn of 2017 there were two quirky early college students sitting in Guilford College's library with nothing in common initially except a pair of quizzical eyes. The one-hundred percent more introverted of the two was this beloved writer right here, yet somehow he instigated the conversation. Meek small talk. You might know it from a bad '90s sitcom. An awkward question about classes here, a half-hearted comment about how daily life is running smoothly there. Hell, I wouldn't be too surprised if he unconsciously threw in a cheesy remark about the weather at some point.

                    It's funny because you might think I was a shy boy confessing to Praveena, but really I was just a nervous wreck around everyone, including some of my own friends. Relatable? I hope so. Yet she was the recent transfer to my high school and I felt a little lonely. There was that feeling coupled with an anxiety from pseudo-inferiority because so many people in my class were an inseparable mix of intellectually brilliant and socially insincere. I guess I was just looking for another friend who I didn't have to feel insecure around.

                    From what I recall, Praveena liked to sport a calm smile and excited eyes towards whomever she was talking to, giving off a distinct impression that she was genuinely listening to what I had to say. It was like a giant plot twist for me: she really was listening. There were a lot of unnecessary questions—left spoken or unspoken—on my part: <i>How did she view adjusting to a smaller class?</i> <i>What brought her to come here?</i> <i>Cats or dogs?</i> Maybe I didn't ask the last one, but it wasn't so irrelevant; I realized they were all typical, tedious, trite questions. In reality, I was confused to find myself in foreign territory—it had been some time since I felt like there really was someone on the other end of the conversation.

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Yet throughout my dribbling mess of conversation, I found Praveena's undivided attention and enthusiasm comforting. My nerves gradually began screaming less at me to silence my guttural nonsense than they were encouraging me to relax and open up about some of my feelings. I told her that I felt caught up in a stress culture. It was never anything like a workload that impressed on me that I might reject my school, but the attitudes some of us took up, me included, that catered more and more towards achieving even the most trivial accomplishments against one another to make us feel reassured in our capabilities. I never knew if I was working towards a goal that was truly mine or just something to one-up the next person.

                    She discussed her past leading up to how she came to transfer to my school halfway through her high school career, how she decided to try to challenge herself in the experience while finding a community that she could bond with.
