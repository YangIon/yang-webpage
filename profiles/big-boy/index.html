                    ctually, for the record, we both agreed this profile would only contain three words: <b>this guy sucks</b>. For the record, I already broke that agreement and for the sake of reading pleasure I don’t regret it. So give me the chance to expand on my previous statement before I lose another train of thought: this guy sucks at being anything other than the life of the party, the alpha, the wisecrack, the <b>uncommonly endearing sort of character</b> you just can’t do without in your life.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>I</b>t’s kind of absurd, the way we met. I’m massaging a bruised corner of my memory in which I recount our <b>fists ramming into each other’s thoracic spine</b>, vicious kicks biting away at the skin on our shins. Guttural noises, cries for mercy, slight cases of <b>anguish-induced tears</b>. A teacher’s face, mortified, as she sat witnessing the <b>behind-the-scenes rendition of fight club</b>. That’s what I remember of fifth grade when it came to him and sometimes I forget to not talk about it. But did we bully each other? <b>Far from it</b>. We just liked to indulge in an eager, unrestrained passion for using each other as <b>personal punching bags</b>. We only grew closer from it. Tough love mixed with painful satisfaction.

                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>D</b>espite the fun times, we eventually got the idea that hitting each other wasn’t particularly optimal for friendly interactions (or our health), so we dropped our aggressive habits—with some minor intervention. I remember years following in middle school when he’d crop up in my life as <b>the token white guy</b> in an all-Asian group breathing the ecstatic atmosphere of Friday nights, a class joker whose innocent humor caught the wrong attention from teachers, or the reptile enthusiast whose enthusiastic knowledge of biology read out like an <b>anthropomorphized encyclopedia</b>. 

                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>A</b>nd honestly, that much hasn’t changed in some ways. Only some contexts altered with the good times sustained; it makes me really <b>nostalgic</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>N</b>o it was really after middle school that everything else became a bit of a blur. We rushed in and out of each other’s lives without saying or doing much. Freshman and sophomore year I reverted to Old Man Logan: grumpy, reserved, and likely <b>preferring to be excluded</b> from other people. You know, the analogy works if you remove the <b>epic backstory</b>, the chic ruffian look, and the (<b>S</b>weet, sweet) adamantium claws. From time to time, something picked me up and kicked my social butt into gear for small periods of time. I made new friends, lost some, <b>rekindled old ones</b>, and faded into ash with the rest hopefully. By senior year, I was essentially rediscovering who he was and what we meant to each other; with some varying degrees of success, I had to (re)define myself as well and try to figure out what spoke out to me as being genuinely valuable.

                    <b>P</b>hrasing Note: For confused readers, the preceding line may also be read as other commonly spoken, somewhat equivalent statements such as:
                    <ul class="f5 lh-copy measure">
                        <li class="pb3">1. "I had to figure out my identity and what I valued."</li>
                        <li class="pb3">2. "I had to reflect on myself and learn to pursue what I wanted out of life."</li>
                        <li class="pb3">3. "I had to regularize the human state and condition of being constantly at odds with certain emotional, logical, intuitive, and irrational contexts in order to provide a satisfactory resolution to the conundrums and contradictions posed by their interaction with one another in me."</li>
                        <li>4. "I had (have) to get my shit together and be happy."</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Then <b>the library talks</b> happened. They weren’t anything too extravagant or out of the ordinary, but they were endowed with a comfortingly insightful atmosphere. Those days when we would find ourselves lounging around on <b>beaten sofas</b> in the school library, I would be <b>wading in a constant stream</b> of discussion on politics, science (biology remained prominent), philosophy, learning modes, and just sharp observations of the world around <b>U</b>s. Well, he was the one doing most of the talking of course. His brain is like a <b>really fast bullet train</b>; his thoughts are running at hundreds of miles per hour. He’s forming connections around him across all these different subjects in academia, in our general lives, in abstraction that it can be overwhelming for other people—or himself. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I don’t know if it was him distancing himself from emotional experiences to save himself the trouble or perhaps <b>the rational side seemed incongruous</b> with his emotions, but I tend to feel that he has frequent conflict consolidating all his learned, objective knowledge with his sentimental self. And that’s the lot of us, <b>incessantly dividing ourselves</b> up between competing perspectives <i>(3)</i> that are cultivated to teach us we don’t know what we thought we knew. <b>Our intuitions can fail us</b> significantly past the early moments when the frame of the world might not be so crooked; yet his explicit effort to learn what he can out of every opportunity is <b>something to be respected</b> for that reason. You may see it often. He brings himself closer and closer to points where that intuition is successful often enough to internalize the experiences in some way for him to determine himself against that more realistic backdrop. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>B</b>y the time you happen to ask a question born out of curiosity about some subject, chances are he’s found an answer in his explorations that will leave you <b>in a buzz</b> with a textbook of knowledge. I’m thinking ketosis, Japanese pop culture dynamics, and nihilism among an <b>ever-increasing list of inquiries</b>. Pretty random, huh? That’s what makes his presence work—all the random bits and pieces find a resolution with him somehow. Don’t get the wrong idea, he’s not some super esoteric, alienated guy as my words seem to paint him out as. He’s….
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    ...a <b>fierce brown bear and a human-sized teddy bear</b> in one. When he’s grounded in determination, he pushes himself within this atypical capacity to hit the last blood-fuming squat set or the <b>impossibly high Jason Derulo note</b> among other instances. There’s also the bottomless stomach, a <b>gaping vacuum</b> consuming every edible ingredient the light touches—think Lion King, but on a greater scale. He devours with an infinite craving and an especially defined palate for <b>banana derivatives</b> (banana bread, banana-nut muffins, banana cream pie, etc.). Next to that, his external demeanor is rather aggressive and you can always count on him to dominate you in a shouting match, rip up a roommate off the floor to be suplexed into their bed, or to really let you know that H<b>E</b>. <b>IS. THE. ALPHA</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I won’t disagree with him on that. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>S</b>o what’s the teddy bear part? It’s not an easy manifestation at first glance, but he’s <b>an extraordinarily caring guy</b> at heart. There’s an empathetic sensibility thriving there that tends to be very subtle and it’s explicit when it counts. When you’re losing out to yourself in the times of frustrating doubts, you know he has your back. Not being one to flake from responsibility (e.g. me, myself, I), he’ll <b>impart that packaged wisdom</b> you’ve come to love and unburden that wounding mentality you might be <b>growing too familiar</b> with. Frankness is his <b>entitlement</b>; candidness his <b>property</b>. Like a few of the people I have come to love, he makes sure that none of the bullshit is involved. You don’t need that in your life and he knows it. He’ll grow with you in the successes and trials, the moments that <b>life wrenches complacency from you</b> and forces you to make a decision—he’s there for all of that and he really makes you think through yourself just like <b>the tanned, fluffy companion</b> lying at the corner of your bed.
