                    f you wanted the best side of who I was or who I might be, then <b>you aren’t going to get that here</b>. Not on this piece. And who knows, maybe the me you see here isn’t all that bad <b>to you</b>, but I don’t like the me here. I don’t think you should either.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I’m going to quickly break down the negatives. Toughen up and be like the gagging kid forcing down the <b>artificially-flavored, anti-happiness,</b> hellspawn grape medicine in record time (and by the way, if you like grape medicine you’re a monster). Ready, set, <b>go</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    In some ways, I projected myself onto her and felt like I hurt her for it. I didn’t have to play the best friend of the day, a <b>Hobbes to a Calvin</b>, an eager bearer of good and bad news when there was no need for me to be that in her life. I wasn’t sure why I was trying to accelerate a friendly relationship at the time and I <b>crashed it into a wall</b> that I should have seen from miles away. There are boundaries between friends. <b>They exist</b>. Who knew? Crazy. And something did come out of the wreckage: a <b>casual friend</b> became a <b>casual pest</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Nice.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <b>Casual pest</b>: a casual, annoying person or thing; a casual nuisance. Something to be avoided as casually as possible. It seemed practical for us to hold to that definition, so we did. We stopped talking for a few months, started to avoid each other because we were reminders of <b>ill feelings and insecurity</b>—as well as my mistakes. We didn’t mind. It was done casually. But I did hurt her and she got me off a <b>high dose of narcissism</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Those interactions defined this <b>unspoken lesson</b> that I could hurt people without ever realizing it, smiling with satisfaction in a <b>cursory sense of myself</b>. An artist’s first face. Sketched-out eyes staring back up from the paper with inscribed potential, but <b>a lack of conscience</b> that the first draft may very well be <b>worse than the rest</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    As a friend, I felt an innate responsibility to be dependable—to everyone—and it made me hyperactive. I thought I could be dependable. I thought I could be <b>really</b> dependable. At that point, what was done was done. We could just forget and move on without another word to each other, but <b>we didn’t forget</b>. Between going to college together and interacting with the same circle of friends, there was always a little bit of tension hanging between us. Did I do anything about it then? Honestly, no. I had no idea how to explain myself. I felt guilty. So I hope I’m at least <b>several drafts ahead</b> by now.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Time ended up being the extra dimension thrown into the mix. A curative. Or really <b>a cop-out</b>, but it worked. Time passed. We began seeing better, more genuine sides of each other. Time passed. We learned that <b>our mistakes don’t define who we are</b> day in, day out. Time passed. We didn’t forget, but eventually we found ourselves in time for a conversation that could clean up <b>all the bad blood</b> we had strewn behind us...
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    <i>Well, you know how I said “quickly”? Sorry, that wasn’t quick or concise, but I think it needed to be said. Exactly how that conversation went when “ten minutes” turned into three hours. It wasn’t quick, but we both needed it. I glossed over the details for now since everything you just read was already becoming a little too much for me… and it’s past 5 AM at this point so there’s that. Writer’s discretion.</i> 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Now those past resentments and mistakes are smaller than us. I take it as a privilege that I am coming to learn more about who she is—and she is <b>truly remarkable</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    She has a lot of small, quirky traits that make her a really lovable human being: her <b>choice of dumb movies</b> where characters die through forearm contact, the fact that she’s <b>naturally photogenic</b> and still denies it, her massive infatuation for all things cute and panda-esque, her <b>impromptu dance parties</b> during the ungodly hours of the night. All lovable in conjunction with <b>everything that makes her admirable</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    There’s a <b>force of nature</b> aspect about her that is stoic, passionate, graceful, and inspiring all at once. It manifests itself when she is solely representing a multi-faceted student body, scaling forty feet walls, <b>breaking fingers tackling all expectations</b> in football, perfecting her classical and hip-hop dance for hours on end, or instructing (disciplining the hell out of) the <b>most unruly, undisciplined group</b> of highschoolers into pulling off a choreograph cover of Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love”. Yet it’s not so much what she does that is beautiful than it is how she conducts herself <b>with unfaltering dedication</b> to anything she devotes her time to. Even in doubt, she displays a certain confidence that those who come to know her for even a single day—that I—want to follow. She’s <b>the general</b> to be admired rather than feared with the power of an entire army in her blood.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    That dedication extends fully to her relationships as well. Sometimes, among our friends, we often joke with her about how small she is. The atom-sized human. But she’s <b>small with a huge heart</b>. There’s a natural propensity within her to communicate and listen to every detail you spring on her on the days when there’s joy, the days when there’s laughter, the days when there’s stupidity, the days when there’s joyful stupidity, and the days <b>when the good feelings are missing</b> and you just need that small shoulder to cry on. She loves celebrating with you when you’ve learned something novel about yourself or (in my case) <b>sending essay responses back to you</b> when you’ve sent her an essay of doubts and revelations from your first semester of college. But if life was a dance, she’d be there to <b>guide your steps</b> in the stumbles, the leaps, and in the times when <b>you deserve the standing ovations</b> you don’t believe you should be receiving. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    So that’s how I see her and now you see it in writing. Like I said, <b>it is a privilege</b> to know her after all.
