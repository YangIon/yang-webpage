                    ello. I’m sitting here trying to carve out the bits of mental material my brain can produce to figure out how I can write about this guy. After an hour, I kind of figured I would come to the conclusion that I don’t actually know how to write about people, particularly the people I value deeply. Maybe I don’t, but it’s <b>kind of contradictory</b> considering that the next few paragraphs will be just that.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    It’s funny because I was going to start off with something pride-crushingly cheesy like “He was my day one…” or some
                    other similar grueling statement. But I thought I should be trying to target the truth; instead, <b>my arrow flew over</b> by
                    a couple tens of feet. I’m going to take <b>another shot at it</b>.

                    He was my day two thousand nine hundred twenty. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Eight years. We were in school together for eight years since fourth grade and we only really knew each other by name. High probability that we only ever exchanged <b>eight sentences in that time</b>, most of which were from him. Middle-school shyness murdered my vocal cords. So in eight years I just knew him as <b>the Indian kid with the tousled black hair</b> that I would sometimes see straddling the other side of crowded hallways. Other people seemed to like him a lot, but I didn’t need to know that—only they did—and I was pretty content with that.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Somehow, year nine forgave all of that. We grew up, life soaring spectacularly in what was going to be our best year yet because we had inherited a sort of <b>infallible, naive exhilaration</b> for ourselves that only juvenile high school seniors felt right claiming. Senior year gave us the cleanest start we could ask for: <b>a time when forming close relationships began to matter more</b> because, quite frankly, we were a little jaded with what the rest of our time in high school had to offer (the sweeter-sounding senioritis).
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    We found each other in the same groups, crashing into experiences within them which felt once-in-a-lifetime. Hah, no insurance could ever replace them. We hadn’t met yet, but exceptional luck and logistical convenience intersected in a time for two very different people to become the best of friends.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    I am fortunate to say my close relationships came early, but unexpectedly so. My friendship with him came at a time when verdant green leaves were being swallowed up in an October blaze and one Skype call later I had <b>bullied a perfectly nice guy into being my friend</b>. Lasting from sunset to sunrise, that call is one thing neither of us regret for a second and I cannot wait to write about <i>that</i>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    But for now, this is about him. A series of chapters in my life that I am reclaiming in tears and smiles and from which new pages are being <b>written every day</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    He’s humble and simultaneously an <b>external model that reflects vibrant confidence and charisma</b>. His personality attracts all sorts of lovely people to him and rightly so. Yet there are times when I feel he can be a little too humble at times that it makes me wonder if he’s undercutting himself much more than he should. But none of it is a facade, that’s just him as someone who genuinely <b>lives life in the moment the way he knows best</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    So the <b>last thing</b> he’ll want to do is to make any sort of trouble for anybody; the <b>first thing</b> he’ll do is to be there for you every step of the way whether you’re in doubt or you just need someone to talk to. A <b>dedicated jack-of-all-trades</b> in fitness, sports, and computer science, he shows a bright interest and a zealous capacity for learning towards all sorts of activities that crop up around him. The best part was that what he enjoyed the most was being able to <b>share these experiences</b> with different people in his life, even other strangers. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    However, a good note to keep in mind: <b>his humor is kind of the opposite of him</b>. It’s coarse, crude, and a little unoriginal at times. He can be found inadvertently pulling <b>“your mom”</b> jokes out of thin air and splaying out puns that can embarrass him more than they entertain him. For that matter, he unintentionally becomes the butt of his own jokes usually. Yet the <b>witless humor</b> is surprisingly <b>charming</b>. Before you realize it, you find yourself laughing until a frothy foam is dripping from the edge of your mouth like some <b>crazed, rabid human</b>. People on the outside will look at you and wonder, quite seriously, what the hell is wrong with you—but does that matter? You are having <b>so. much. damn. fun.</b> A part of your mind tells you, “Holy shit. I love this guy.” And we do; <b>we all really do</b>. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    So...
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Eight years. We were in school for eight years since fourth grade without knowing a single thing about each other and now we’re learning <b>everything</b>. What I appreciate constantly about him is that when I’m being dumb, he’ll make sure I know it—tell it to me straight—but in a manner that lets me know <b>he was considering my words</b> carefully. I am conscious of the fact that he treats everyone in his life <b>like family</b> and he makes time for others like they’re family. I love that. Every day, he displays this remarkable capability to work through his issues head-on in a calm manner that speaks volumes about his character. I love that. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Honestly, I could keep going on about him, but I think this is a good stopping point for now. A random thought just popped up into my mind: he once called me <b>his emotional rock</b>, but if that’s the case then he’s my emotional boulder. I love that.
