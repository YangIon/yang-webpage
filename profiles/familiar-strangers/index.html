                    t’s not often that we discover villains stalking the shadows amidst the crowd, silently terrorizing the hearts of adults and children everywhere. Imagine finding one right next to you while living to tell the tale—you couldn’t before but <b>now I’m here</b>. This one in particular is especially nefarious. She’s an agent whose artifice and deception silence the innocent. At other times, a tyrant whose heavy hand strikes freely. Brutality is her accomplice, exerting a force that can shatter willpower down to its foundation. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Based on these genuine facts, you may be surprised to find that there was a time when there was good in her. As I enjoy keeping things positive even in the dark times, I will save you from the gory despair for now. However, don’t let these next few paragraphs deceive you; this is not a redemption story, but <b>a perfectly honest observation</b> of the Happy Thought Villain. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    When I was first introduced to her with a mutual friend, it was with closed eyes. Everything happened quickly. Names were exchanged, greetings were smiled at, and soon enough I found myself sitting quietly to help that friend and a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed stranger with some work due the next day. I was ready.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    But wow... that couch was <i>especially</i> comfortable. The <b>soft fabric cloud hugging my skin</b> closely, the slight warmth in that darkened room seeping into the seat and my limbs, a pair of armrests cushioning my oh-so-delicate hands at precisely the right height. And in the background a pair of muted voices—wait, oh n—
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    “...thank you for listening to my presentation. Questions?” Yes. Can you go over the last fifteen or so slides comprising the entire presentation again? I don’t think I caught… any of it. 
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    In the good year of 2018, I had slept through innumerable lectures, discussions, movies, concerts, and conversations to be named <b>the year’s Best Snorlax</b>. I was a veteran to all inappropriately timed sleepers. But in that good year of 2018, I felt like I had colored myself in a deep shade of embarrassment. The best thing was that the two people reciting PowerPoint slides a few feet away, despite catching me drifting off, probably didn’t mind a single bit anyhow. Who knew I could be so self-conscious?
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Uh… everyone.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    You know what, it didn't matter. I didn't have to care because I could graduate without this stranger ever becoming a witness to another one of life's awkward moments—I was certain of that. But then again, I guess there's some reason you're reading this now.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Among a Halloween evening spent writing essays while disparaging our lack of literacy, a few dinners where <b>grapes were slowly stripped of their decency</b> by means of two front teeth, study sessions where one of us or the other had our eyebrows knit together in stress (cough, cough), and late-late nights spent with her rediscovering how lovely—or traumatic—past experiences like marching band were, I found myself talking more and more to a familiar stranger.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    These were the people that after some time made you wonder why you were strangers in the first place. In the most absurd sense, as you get to know them maybe you feel like <b>you’re staring into a mirror</b>—when did my thoughts start assuming a human body? You’re sitting by, listening to a knowing echo resounding through the room. It might sound a little self-centered at first until you realize you’re just undeniably happy that you found <b>people who will understand</b> everything you possess.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    There are definitely quirks about her that made me reminisce about the past and reconsider the present. For one, she has an ebullient, yet critical sort of attitude towards every minor detail found in writing letters and characters by hand, taking collective issue with how <i>W’s, U’s, 2’s,</i> and <i>9’s</i> should be written. Should you dot your <i>i’s</i> and <i>j’s</i>? Is the <i>K</i> better as script or cursive? Let’s not get started on the diagonal line trailing on the number <i>7</i>. If any of these issues ensued like they did for me throughout high school, then you know there’s at least two other people who empathize with these pain points. Worst of all is that agonizing feeling when you have to erase a suddenly unnecessary word that <b>was written perfectly</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Some parallels are simply interesting. Her focus on the <b>minutiae of daily life</b> often borders overthinking and excessive scrutinization. Yet at the same time it helps her carry a strong memory and a keen eye for detail both of which never let anything by. Me? I’m proud to say that I only seem to carry the overthinking side…
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Others are not so fun. I like to imagine it as stress burying itself deep, revealing only insignificant signs on the outside. When frustrations develop, they begin and continue on muted lips but <b>roar inside like thunder</b>. Silence is both ambiguous and explicit towards the typical, “What’s up?”. The idea of pure vulnerability buzzes around the head annoyingly, but it can often be ignored for better or worse.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Yet while I loved finding someone like her, eventually she started becoming a series of projections. So my fears, interests, quirks, and the quiet, unrevealing understanding that seemed beyond surreal all caught up to me and slapped me hard with feelings. She was also someone I realized I was beginning to idolize too much; a part of me was looking hard at that mirror and <b>mentally trying to live a life through someone else’s</b>. Unintentionally, I had created this gap in understanding who she really was and I didn't fully separate my own concerns from hers.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Honestly, I should have just discarded the mirror example earlier because everything I thought I understood about her was already blurry in so many spots, but I just assumed the distorted image was similar enough—just like me.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Now I’m wiping them away and finding that the similarities are less and less. Yet many differences are <b>characteristics to be celebrated</b>. I suppose when I began truly seeing that I could define who the—real—Happy Thought Villain was.
                </p>
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Some days she can be a <b>self-denying, yet dedicated</b> Chinese teacher who knows how to hammer in the difference between the 小姐s from the 笑姐s for someone like me who keeps getting chills trying to speak the language otherwise (Wǒ yoooooo). When she’s not flying ribbons in spectacular dances that leave you breathless or ruling an empire of statisticians as the Supreme Almighty Divine Vice Chancellor, she’s working herself slightly to death perhaps in preparation to plot the end of the world as we know it. 
                </p>
                 <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Sarcasm and absolute nonsense don’t get past her too well. The reaper of joy, she breaks such transgressions with the most judgmental expressions and statements. In the worst of times, you may find <b>a fist swooping down to crush your scapula</b>. All you can realistically do at that point is cower in fear and cry yourself to sleep. 
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    For that matter, she never truly sleeps so even the most tested have to keep their vigil about them. Her technique is something special as it allows her to perform something like “closing the eyes for an extended period of time (est. range from 4 to 10 hours) while still listening.”
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    She’s someone who champions many titles and claims to infamy, someone you can’t help but notice. While it can be slightly irritating to talk to her at times—particularly when I’m the most forgiving and exceptionally brilliant hero who will save us all from calamity at her hands—what with her cryptic responses and their more recent <b>Italian dish counterparts</b>, she’s best known to me in the good times as one of the most awesome friends I made since coming to college.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure i">
                    Writer’s he-doesn’t-know-how-to-fit-a-lot-of-continuity-onto-the-paper-well Note: Trust me. I don’t see any contradictions whatsoever with everything I’ve said up to this point ⌃_⌃
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Sometimes being her friend has you fearing for your life. From the grim stares at hilarious puns which make you feel like a <b>friend ship is sinking under</b> to the swift retribution in moments that makes you realize “well I screwed up”, you might find yourself slightly on edge about whether you’ll wake up to see the sun overhead tomorrow.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Yeah, she’s certainly scary and downright mean at times, but she’s a fun one to be around. Her reactions to cold food and the revival of “tummy bunnies”. That’s worth it. The count of 3 or 4 AM nights where we’re all doing and saying dumb stuff for a happiness that <b>isn’t so dumb</b> after all. Worth it. Her off-the-cuff innovations on <i>happy thoughts</i> and aesthetic content as well as her eager disposition towards <b>generic calligraphy</b> and cute cartoon animals.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    All worth it because those are also the moments in which I feel <b>genuine love towards myself</b> for being even one part in this remarkable person’s life.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    And it’s becoming the most natural feeling in the world. 
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    She’s shown me that there are a number of things that are truly beautiful about me as a friend. When we’re all learning as permanent students of our own identities, I can still welcome my sincerity into the fold and transform it into the same care, love, and cultivation I <b>admire so much in other people</b>. I’m not thinking of craning my neck a few tens of degrees upward to look up to something or someone that I feel I can’t be. And I’m worthwhile, I just had to realize it.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    Because there are always times when we can’t realize that and those are the times we then try to force ourselves not to. The times when we’re presented with some <b>extraordinarily ugly, unnervingly real</b> things in ourselves that often we just have to trust ourselves to work with. Raw, untempered thoughts and feelings that we tuck away, bury, shelter from view. As negative as they might seem, these are the items swirling madly in ourselves <b>that are misunderstood</b>. We chose to contextualize them as weaknesses to be discarded, never realizing how much more they would contribute to our growth once we consolidated them.
                </p> 
                <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                    At the end of the day, I’ve found a very human experience with her that has been <b>a medley</b> of these misunderstandings. And yet I’m learning to put myself on a track of accepting what I fear in myself. She isn’t actually the supposed villain of the story—what, plot twist—because who she is is a beautiful, caring, sociable figure who may be <b>more of a hero</b> to others than she is to herself. Even then there were no villains—only <b>ourselves</b>.
