            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                I spent most of my middle school and high school years as the quiet, introverted sort of character. Most events with people just seemed to pass right over me whether I cared for them to or not—atleast, that's what I liked to tell myself at one point.
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                It turns out that as I started becoming closer with other people (and I honestly couldn't tell you when that started happening), the more I became interested in who I was to them. The implicit value of intimate, strong relationships increased for me and I started reflecting more on the contributions relationships made towards my quality of life.
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                I've written and rewritten this page many times. In fact, let me just say right here and now that every page you see on this "digital journal" will have already gone through tens or hundreds of iterations before you ever laid eyes on them. It's pretty obvious that they'll never be finished because my views on myself and my influences are invariably changing. 
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                In reality, there are a plethora of outside forces transpiring around me that affect what I do, how I think, and generally who I am as a person in my day-to-day environment. Yet like the next person you find, there's still a subtle directive to discern what will influence my own life in the end—that's something I've only recently come to terms with.
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                So, a primary group of these forces are comprised of all the influential people I have met / am getting to know throughout the years and everything I gain from their presence in my life. These are the people whom I can confidently say taught me my personal definitions of love, identity, self-care, discipline, learning, etc. These are the types of people whom I believe we should all have in our lives.
            </p> 
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                For all they've done for me, at the very least I want to provide some written dedication to them.
            </p>
