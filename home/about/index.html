                Huge friend crushes, frequent ruminations on the events and lessons I derive from the people around me, and idyllic written accounts that are borderline glorifications of my peers and loved ones until they seem to represent some impossibly exemplary characters resembling idols rather than actual friends.
           </p>
            <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                And just like Lara Jean, I’ll enter into a fantasy world about people which I don’t like being broken out of in this peculiarly normal sense of hope and fear. It’s stubborn, I know. While I’m pretty eager to fill my head to the brim with my own ideals on what my interpersonal relationships look like—surprise, surprise—those ideals don’t often hold up well in real life. 
           </p> 
           <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                That being said, it’s a really beautiful experience to figure out all sorts of real things about yourself and what types of roles these relationships present to you. What caring for one another is really like, how responsibility lies between people, when laughter and love feel absolutely natural to you because of the things you shared with someone else. 
           </p> 
           <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                Guess what? There’s also a you-to-you relationship.
           </p> 
           <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                It’s all about expectations vs. realities. So this kind of abstract learning constitutes many forms; even if lessons are obvious, sometimes they can’t be imagined in ways that make sense to who you think you are sometimes. Often you’re failing, spiralling out of control in a seamless manner only to slide back into yourself and rediscover completeness when you least expect it. Your reality can be unexpected and it’s rarely consistent with your expectations so reality will humble them. When these subtle lessons come, you have to own up to them. You get to relive the repeated experience in which all the learned pieces that are realistic are far more ideal than your ideals, far more hurtful than your projected adversities. It all comes from your best friend and worst enemy—yourself.
           </p> 
           <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                That’s how we arrive at this project. At base, it’s a singular perspective reflecting on a multitude of connections. I haven’t lived through enough of my life to claim any significant degree of expertise on what people stand to gain by observing the relationships that gain traction throughout the years. Yet I do believe we reflect ourselves through the people we come to associate ourselves with. Here, you will find just a few of the remarkably awesome, remarkably flawed, and remarkably cherished influences that have taught me an enormous amount since I encountered them. You’ll also find me written between (or not-so-between) the lines. 
           </p>

                This is also my way of extending a small hand of gratitude to these people. I hope that when they read these passages they get something out of it. Something to think about. And hopefully that something supports them in the long run.
           </p> 
           <p class="f4 lh-copy measure">
                In the end, regardless of what type of audience is going in and consuming my writing, I hope the reader can find something good to bring back into their own lives. We don’t have to live vicariously through others, but we ought to express our love to the people that mattered the most, when we needed that same love the most.
